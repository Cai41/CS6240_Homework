1. To run the programe locally, first copy all image files into one folder
2. Open Makefile, change local.input to the folder you just created
3. Change local.xx, local.yy and local.zz to your preference, these are the dimension of neighborhood points
4. Change local.sample.size to your preference, this is the sample size of final output
5. "make alone" to run them locally
6. After the program ends, there should be 2 output folders, one is output_result, which is json file 
of all ${local.sample.siz}e points, another one is output_image, which contains pictures of one foreground
and one background point. There should be (2 x local.zz) number of pictures, each of them is in one layer.
